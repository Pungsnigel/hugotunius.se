    </header>
    <p>I am a Swedish programmer from Stockholm. I work as a developer at <a href="http://fishbrain.com">Fishbrain</a>. Previously I've studied Computer Science at Gothenburg University, during my time in Gothenburg I also worked at <a href="http://ctk.se">Chalmers Teknologkonsulter</a> as an IT Consultant and during the fall of 2013 I held the position of Business Area Manager for the IT department</p>
    <p>My endless interest in all things computer and programming related has found me working with a wide range of technologies, tasks and languages. From GPGPU to web design from server administration to hardware a true jack of all trades. The challenges of programming and the rewards of expanding my knowledge keeps me tethered to computers.</p>
